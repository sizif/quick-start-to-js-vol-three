/*
CREATING OBJECTS
----------------

We can create objects in 2 ways:

OBJECT LITERAL where we crate an object and its instance at the same time
OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR where we create as many obj instances as needed

There are 3 kinds of objs in JS:

HOST - defined by the environment (Window)
CORE - build into the language (Match. Object, String)
Defined by coder
